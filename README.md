# Graph Interface & Implementation

### Part 1 - implement graphs (50 points)

Implement our interfaces **IVertex**, **IEdge**, **IGraph** with classes
**Vertex**, **Edge**, **Graph** (with exactly these names). (30 points.)
Implement conversion from and to dot format (from the interface
**IGraph**). (20 points.)

### Part 2 - find paths (50 points)


Depth-first and breadth-first search (20 points)
Shortest paths with Dijkstra's algorithm (20 points)
Find paths with the A* algorithm (10 points)


The implemented methods return an object of type **Result**, which
includes the following Optional fields:
- path
- list of visited vertices
- path cost

For full marks, all the fields should be present and correct. You get
partial marks if only some of them are present and correct.
